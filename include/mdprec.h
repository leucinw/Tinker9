/**
 * \ingroup prec
 * \def TINKER_DETERMINISTIC_FORCE
 * Logical macro for the underlying type of energy gradients.
 *    - If `true`, always use fixed-point arithmetic to accumulate energy
 *    gradients, regardless of the underlying type of each individual component.
 *    - If `false`, use type `real`, which can either be `float` or `double`
 *    based on the precision macro.
 *
 * \see TINKER_DOUBLE_PRECISION
 * \see TINKER_MIXED_PRECISION
 * \see TINKER_SINGLE_PRECISION
 *
 * In general, evaluating energy, forces, etc. twice, we don't expect to get
 * two identical answers, but we may not care as much because the difference
 * is usually negligible.
 * [See [Why is cos(x) !=
 * cos(y)?](https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/newbie#floating-point-arith2)]
 * Whereas in MD, two simulations with the same initial configurations can
 * easily diverge due to the accumulated difference. If, for whatever reason,
 * you are willing to elongate the process of the inevitable divergence at the
 * cost of slightly slower simulation speed, a more "deterministic" force (using
 * fixed-point arithmetic) can help.
 *
 * To accumulate floating-point values via fixed-point arithmetic, we first
 * scale the values by a large integer then sum only the integer part.
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // fixed sum;
 * // FLT is float or double
 * FLT val2 = val * 0x100000000ull;
 * sum += (fixed)((long long)val2);
 * \endcode
 * To get the floating-point sum, we have to cast the integer sum back to
 * floating-point number, then divide it by the same large integer.
 * \code{.cpp}
 * FLT val2 = (FLT)((long long)sum);
 * FLT answer = val2 / 0x100000000ull;
 * \endcode
